### Introduction
We first explored training different models to recognize sketches in the Quick Draw dataset. We found that a hand-crafted CNN can be trained in a short time and achieve reasonable accuracy. 
With a trained CNN, we are able to perform various interesting tasks, such as: **inter-class similarity analysis**, **CNN class activation map visualization for interpretability**, **definitive stroke analysis and visualization**, and finally, to **hint the players of Quick Draw** with our CNN and Sketch RNN.

Technics from papers[1,2] are used in our work.
